<h1>Story 6</h1>

  <p>The air in the Yoyogi National Gymnasium was thick and electric, a pressurized cocktail of sweat, desperation, and roaring sound that vibrated in Mariya Volkov’s teeth. Chalk dust, smelling of dry earth and ambition, hazed the stark arena lights. For the Party, for the collective, for the Motherland. The mantra was a drumbeat in her skull, a ward against the dizzying scale of it all. She was a perfect instrument, a sculpture of muscle and will, honed for this single purpose. Her focus, a laser, found its target: Anne Miller, USA. The American was stretching, a picture of casual, untroubled power. Privilege.</p>
  <p>Anne approached the vault. The crowd’s roar subsided to a expectant hum. Mariya watched, analyzing, her own hands mechanically working the chalk block. The fine white powder coated her fingers, a familiar, desiccating film. Anne rubbed her palms together, a final, practiced gesture. She turned her wrist, and the light caught it—a silvery, jagged line bisecting her palm.</p>
  <p>The world did not slow. It shattered.</p>
  <p>Darkness. The reek of wet stone and mildew. A sharp cry—not her own. Anne’s. The terrifying lurch and tumble down hard-edged basement steps. The coppery scent of blood. The grim-faced woman. The terrifying glint of a needle. The visceral, scratchy pull of black thread through tender flesh. Her own small hand clenching in a searing wave of sympathetic pain.</p>
  <p>Mariya’s breath hitched. The gymnasium’s roar flattened into a high, piercing whine. Her stomach roiled, the taste of her morning tea—bitter and floral—rising in her throat. The memory wasn’t a thought; it was a full-sensory assault, a ghost limb screaming back to life.</p>
  <p>“Volkova!” Coach Orlova’s voice was a distant crack, a whip from another world. “Eyes forward!”</p>
  <p>But Mariya was adrift. She could only stare at the American, who was now shaking out her limbs, utterly oblivious. The stoic discipline that was her armor, her very identity, had vaporized. In its place was a terrifying, silent void.</p>
  <p>Later, in the sterile quiet of her room, the scent of Soviet-issue disinfectant couldn’t mask the tension. Colonel Zaitsev stood by the window, a silhouette against the neon Tokyo night. He didn’t turn. His voice, when it came, was quiet, calm, and colder than a January dawn on the steppe.</p>
  <p>“The American is a phantom, Comrade Volkova,” he stated, each word precise, surgical. “A psychological construct designed to destabilize our strongest. They dangle a past that does not exist to poison your present, which belongs to the Motherland.” He finally turned. His eyes were flat, devoid of warmth. “To entertain this fiction is not weakness. It is treason. Your family in Odessa enjoys their comforts because of your loyalty. Their peace is tied to your performance. Do not make them share your… confusion.”</p>
  <p>The door clicked shut behind him. The silence he left was heavier than the noise. Mariya stood frozen, the chill of his threat seeping into her bones.</p>
  <p>Then, a faint rustle. A slip of paper under the door. Her heart hammered against her ribs as she unfolded it. The handwriting was a desperate scrawl. The west stairwell. Now. I have the truth. - A.</p>
  <p>Fear was a taste of iron in her mouth. But the pull of the void, the need to fill it, was stronger. She moved like a ghost through the corridors, the linoleum cool beneath her feet. In the concrete gloom</p>
  <p>of the service stairwell, a man with her own eyes stepped from the shadows. He smelled of foreign tobacco and rain. He held out a creased, faded photograph. The paper felt fragile, sacred.</p>
  <p>“The twentieth convoy,” her brother, Alexei, whispered, the words choked. “The train to Auschwitz. They saved us. They could not save them.”</p>
  <p>His story was a torrent—the gunfire, the shouting, the desperate hands pulling them from the cattle car. The frantic flight to Kiev. The fall on the stairs. The scar. The truth was not a theory. It was a bone-deep ache, a song half-remembered on the edge of sleep. It was the smell of blood and damp wool. It was real.</p>
  <p>The door burst open. Zaitsev’s men. Rough hands grabbed her, yanking her away from the only real thing she’d ever known. The Colonel’s face was a stone mask of fury. “You are a child of the state,” he hissed, his breath hot on her ear. “You are nothing more.”</p>
  <p>The day of the finals dawned, grey and tense. Mariya performed her routines with a mechanical precision, a marionette on strings of duty and fear. But as she launched into the air for her final vault, a strange calm descended. This was not for Zaitsev. This was for the parents whose faces she now knew. For the little girl in the dark, holding her sister’s hand.</p>
  <p>She landed. Perfect. Still. The crowd’s eruption was a distant wave. Coach Orlova’s triumphant shout faded into nothing.</p>
  <p>Mariya’s gaze swept past the Soviet delegation, past Zaitsev’s triumphant smirk. She found Anne, waiting in the wings, and then Alexei, a steady presence in the chaotic stands.</p>
  <p>She stepped off the mat. And she walked. Away from her coach, away from her team, across the bright, exposed floor toward the American delegation. The crowd’s cheer curdled into a bewildered murmur.</p>
  <p>She stopped before Anne. Wordless, she reached out. Gently, she took her sister’s hand, turning the scarred palm to the light. She placed her own unmarked palm against it, a perfect fit.</p>
  <p>A gasp. Anne’s eyes—her own eyes—widened, flooding with a dawning, devastating recognition. A sob, raw and broken, escaped her lips as she fell into her sister’s arms. The flashbulbs erupted around them, a silent storm of light, capturing not a defection, but a reconciliation. The void was gone. Filled. She was whole.</p>
