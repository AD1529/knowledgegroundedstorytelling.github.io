<h1>Story 10</h1>

  <p>April 19, 1943. The train to Auschwitz thundered through the Belgian countryside, its iron wheels</p>
  <p>shrieking against the tracks. Inside, the air was thick—damp wool, stale bread, the metallic tang of fear.</p>
  <p>Maria Livschitz pressed her cheek to Anne’s, their breath mingling, their small bodies trembling with</p>
  <p>every jolt. The world outside was a blur of gray fields and distant smoke, but inside the carriage, time</p>
  <p>slowed to the rhythm of their mother’s whispered lullabies and the distant sobs of strangers.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, the night exploded. Gunshots cracked like thunder, shouts ricocheted off steel. The door</p>
  <p>burst open, and a man—Youra Livchitz, wild-eyed, smelling of sweat and gunpowder—grabbed the</p>
  <p>twins, thrusting them into the chaos. Anne’s hand caught on a jagged edge; blood welled, warm and</p>
  <p>shocking. Maria watched, paralyzed, as the wound was stitched in the flickering lamplight, the acrid</p>
  <p>scent of iodine burning her nose. The scar, raw and angry, became a secret map etched into Anne’s</p>
  <p>palm—and into Maria’s memory.</p>
  <p>Years unraveled. Odessa’s winters bit at Maria’s skin, the taste of black bread and cabbage lingering on</p>
  <p>her tongue. Gymnastics halls echoed with the slap of bare feet on polished wood, the sharp tang of</p>
  <p>chalk dust. Maria learned to master her body, to silence the ache in her chest with perfect landings and</p>
  <p>rigid discipline. In Los Angeles, Anne soared beneath golden light, her laughter ringing through sunlit</p>
  <p>gyms, her scar hidden beneath layers of rosin and hope.</p>
  <p>Tokyo, 1964. The Olympic stadium shimmered with heat and tension, banners snapping in the breeze.</p>
  <p>Maria, draped in Soviet red, stood behind Anne, the American star, as they prepared for the vault. The</p>
  <p>air was electric—sweat, anticipation, the faint sweetness of cherry blossoms drifting in from the city.</p>
  <p>Anne dipped her hands into chalk, the powder swirling, settling into the creases of her scar. Maria’s</p>
  <p>heart hammered. The past surged: the train, the blood, the loss.</p>
  <p>Irina Ivanovna Volkova’s voice sliced through the haze. “Focus, Maria. The past is weakness.” Her</p>
  <p>breath was sharp, her perfume a cold blend of tobacco and lavender. Maria’s muscles tensed, but her</p>
  <p>gaze remained fixed on Anne’s hand. The scar was not just Anne’s—it was a bridge, a wound that</p>
  <p>refused to heal.</p>
  <p>Anne vaulted, her body arcing through the air, the crowd’s roar swelling and fading. Maria stepped</p>
  <p>forward, the floor cool beneath her feet, the taste of adrenaline sharp on her tongue. She felt the weight</p>
  <p>of history, the pull of memory, and the possibility of peace.</p>
  <p>After the competition, the sisters found each other in a quiet corridor, the hum of distant applause</p>
  <p>muffled by thick walls. Anne reached out, her palm open, scar gleaming in the fluorescent light. Maria</p>
  <p>touched it, her fingers trembling. The silence between them was heavy, fragrant with longing and</p>
  <p>forgiveness. Words were unnecessary; the touch said everything.</p>
  <p>Irina’s footsteps echoed, but Maria no longer flinched. She had faced the wound, embraced the pain,</p>
  <p>and in that moment, the world narrowed to the warmth of Anne’s hand in hers. The war outside raged</p>
  <p>on, but for two sisters, peace had finally arrived—tasting of salt, chalk, and the sweetness of reunion.</p>
