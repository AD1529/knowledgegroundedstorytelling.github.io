<h1>Story 4</h1>

  <p>The air in the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium was a chalk-thick fug, tasting of dried sweat and anticipation. For Manya Livitsky, it was the only air she knew. It was the air of Odessa, of a decade of dawns spent in a gym that was more home than any apartment. She was a statue in Soviet red, her muscles coiled, her mind a vault. Calm was a performance, and she was its master. Memory was a weakness she had purged long ago.</p>
  <p>Behind her, the American, Anne Smith, prepared. The sound was a familiar ritual: the slap of palms on chalk, the soft puff of excess powder. Then, a shift. Anne turned, her hand flicking. The light caught the pale, twisted rope of a scar that carved across her palm.</p>
  <p>The lock on the vault of Masha’s mind didn’t just break. It shattered.</p>
  <p>*The world shrank to the smell of wet wool and fear in a dark train car. The shriek of tearing metal. Then, later, the dank, cellar smell of a Belgian safehouse. A steep, stone staircase. Anne, just ahead, a small shadow. A cry. A tumble. The metallic tang of blood, shockingly vivid. The lamplight catching the eye of a needle. The gut-wrenching pull of thread through her sister’s flesh. Her own scream, a silent, frozen thing in her chest.*</p>
  <p>The present rushed back—the roar of the crowd, a distant ocean. Her name, called over the loudspeaker, sounded alien. Colonel Volkov’s gaze, from the shadows, was a physical weight, cold and assessing. Her legs, numb, carried her to the runway. The vault was a blur. She hit the springboard, her body a perfect, betrayed machine. The landing was a stumble that sent a jolt up her spine, a tiny earthquake in the perfect Soviet facade.</p>
  <p>That night, in the sterile silence of her room, the ghost would not be quiet. *Marie*, it whispered. Her name was Marie. The American was Anne. Their saviour was a man named Youra, with a smile like a sliver of sun, who had wrenched them from a train bound for the ovens.</p>
  <p>Volkov came. The smell of cheap tobacco and cold wool preceded him. His voice was a low, precise instrument. “This sentiment is a sickness, Comrade Livitsky. A bourgeois infection. That woman is a provocateur. You are a daughter of the Soviet Union. You are nothing else.” His words were meant to be a surgeon’s scalpel, cutting away the weakness. They felt like a boot heel.</p>
  <p>But the lock was broken. A single sheet of paper, slipped under her door, sealed it. The script was spidery, thin ink on thinner paper. *“I knew your mother, Chana. I hid you with Youra. What you remember is real. -Sofia.”* The paper smelled faintly of dust and time. Truth. It had a scent.</p>
  <p>The next day, Volkov played his final card. He cornered her in a concrete corridor that smelled of disinfectant and damp. “The Western jackals want a story,” he hissed. “You will feed them one. You will stand before their cameras and denounce her as a liar. A CIA puppet.” He moved closer, his breath a foul cloud. “If you refuse, Coach Petrova will find her career… over. Her apartment, reassigned. Do you understand the price of your indulgence?”</p>
  <p>The weight was immense, a physical pressure on her lungs. The Motherland that had forged her now demanded she annihilate herself.</p>
  <p>She walked to the floor for the balance beam. The four-inch-wide apparatus was a precipice. Volkov watched, a smug certainty in his cold eyes. Petrova watched, her face a mask of terrified pride.</p>
  <p>Masha closed her eyes. Not to find the void. To find the memory.</p>
  <p>She mounted the beam.</p>
  <p>And then, she did not perform.</p>
  <p>She remembered.</p>
  <p>Her first movement was not a choreographed leap but a faltering step—the stumble of a child on a dark staircase. Her arms windmilled, not for points, but for survival against a remembered fall. The crowd gasped, a single, sharp intake of breath.</p>
  <p>Then she began to move. Her routine unraveled into a raw, brutal truth. A series of furious, tight spins became the claustrophobic terror of the cattle car. A high, arching flip was the violent, liberating explosion of the resistance attack. Her movements were not sleek; they were jagged, a heart beating outside a chest. She was not Masha Livitsky of Odessa. She was Marie of Mechelen, pulling her sister from a fall, mourning parents lost to the smoke, reaching across twenty years of silence.</p>
  <p>She finished in a perfect, still pose. The silence was absolute, a vacuum. Then, the arena erupted—not the polite applause for a victor, but a chaotic, thunderous wave of awe and confusion.</p>
  <p>She had not given them Soviet perfection. She had given them a soul.</p>
  <p>She looked at Volkov. His face was a pale, rigid mask of utter, defeated fury. His ideology had no language for this. She had not defected. She had simply become whole, and in doing so, she had rendered him obsolete.</p>
  <p>She walked off the floor, past him, towards the American delegation. Towards Anne, whose face was a mirror of her own tear-streaked chalk dust.</p>
  <p>She did not embrace her. Not yet. She simply held up her own clean, unmarked palm.</p>
  <p>“I remember,” Marie said, her voice rough, yet clear.</p>
  <p>And for the first time since the world went dark in a boxcar, she was finally, perfectly, at peace.</p>
