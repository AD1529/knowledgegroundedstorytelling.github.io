  <h1>Story 1</h1>

  <p>The chalk moves like weather when she claps—white flurries bloom, the bitter tang of magnesium sharp on her tongue. Mariia counts because numbers behave when nothing else does. Four in, four out. Board, block, lift, spot.</p>

<p>Tokyo hums around her: announcers stitching names into languages, camera shutters clicking like insects, brass notes drifting from the concourse. The American gymnast steps up—midnight-blue leotard, a star on her chest. She opens her palm to the chalk.</p>

<p>A pale seam cuts its center. A white river.</p>

<p>The lid of Mariia’s memory lifts. Coal smoke, whistles, doors banging open. Cold air biting skin. A scarfed stranger’s voice urging “Come.” Her small body lifted from a train bound for Auschwitz.</p>

<p>“Соколенко,” calls a clipped voice. Galina Zorina, Party minder, clipboard in hand, perfume neat as paper.</p>

<p>“No wandering. No chatter with foreigners. You know the rules, Masha.”</p>

<p>Masha to the team, Mariia in records, Marie in memory.</p>

<p>“I know,” she answers.</p>
